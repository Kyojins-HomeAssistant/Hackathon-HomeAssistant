### Setup

Clone the repository, then move to the project folder and run at first the  ```SetupVenv.bat``` and then the ```SetupLibraries.bat``` batch files.
Now that the virtual environment is ready, run ```python main.py``` to test the App

### Possible Issue Running the App

We used ```mpv``` library to play the songs. In some instances, it may not work even after installing the library with ```pip```.

A possible but a bit tedious workaround has been found. Please contact us if this issue shows up.

We have added screenshots of the app running for convenience.
